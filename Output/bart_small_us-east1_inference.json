The planet, located 40 light-years away in the constellation Virgo, orbits within the temperature range where liquid water could exist on its surface. The discovery team includes researchers from the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and international collaborators. This groundbreaking discovery utilized the combined capabilities of the Keck Observatory and Subaru Telescope, both situated at the 13,796-foot summit of Hawaii."

      "summary": "Hawaii has reached a historic milestone in its transition to renewable energy by 2045. This achievement places Hawaii well ahead of its ambitious goal to achieve 100 percent renewable energy. The Big Island leads the transformation with 80 percent renewable penetration, primarily from geothermal energy tapped from Kilauea volcano's heat and extensive solar farms across Kona and Hilo districts. Oahu's grid integration challenges are being addressed through smart grid technology and distributed energy resources including rooftop solar installations on over 100,000 homes. Hawaii's success serves as a model for island nations worldwide seeking energy independence."
